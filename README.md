<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>The lab gave me hands on experience conducting a vulnerability scan against a targt endpoint within the network using the industry standard vulnerability scanner Nessus. After scanning the deprecated version of Windows 10 and discovering numerous vulnerabilities, I went through and remedaited them through downloading security patches, updating or removing applications such as bloatware that unnessarily incrased the attack surface on the endpoint device.
