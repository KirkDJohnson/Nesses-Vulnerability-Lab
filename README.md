<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>The lab gave me hands on experience conducting a vulnerability scan against a targted endpoint within the network using the industry standard Nessus. After scanning the deprecated version of Windows 10 and discovering numerous vulneriblites, I went through and remedaited the vulnerbilties through downloading security patches, updating or removing applications such as bloatware that unnessarily incrased the attack surface on the endpoint device.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>Oracle Virtual Box (VM)</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

AAfter remediating as the critical, high, medium, and low vulnerbilites. Ran another credentialed scan against the VM <br/>
