<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab gave me hands on experience conducting a vulnerability scan against a target endpoint within the network using the industry standard vulnerability scanner Nessus. After scanning the deprecated version of Windows 10 and discovering numerous vulnerabilities, I first conducted some extra research about them that Nessus did not provide. Once I knew more about the vulnerabilities and recommendations on to remedaite them, I went through downloading security patches, updating or removing applications such as bloatware that unnecessarily incrased the attack surface on the endpoint device.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>Oracle Virtual Box (VM)</b>
- <b>NIST National Vulnerability Database</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<br />Example of researching the vulnerabilites found, their related exploit, and ways to remediate them<br/>

<br />
<br />
After remediating all the critical, high, medium, and low vulnerbilites. Ran another credentialed scan against the VM <br/>

<br />
<br />
Vulnerabilities remedaitied. Endpoint hardened.<br/>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
This was a pretty simple yet beneficial lab for me to expand my knowledge of blue-team skills. By becoming exposed and getting hands on experience using Nessus, setting up a scan and seeing the steps it took to conduct a credentialed scan against a VM that wasn't in the same domain was an incredibility complicated process that I did not outline but boosted my knowledge of using the windows registry. Furthermore, researching the vulnerabilies found and remediating them, despite being just a few was good practice on endpoint harding and vulnerability management/reduction that is likely done in real life.
